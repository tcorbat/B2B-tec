# Week 4 Exercise

In these exercises you will look for and apply the patterns of the lecture to the B2B-tec software.


## Composite Pattern

A typical application of the composite pattern are graphical user interfaces. B2B-tec features a Java Swing-based user interface that also applies that pattern to compose its elements. While this applies to the whole interface we focus on the *Profile* tab in the main view as an example.

The main panel of the *Profile* tab is specified by the `ProfileTabBase` class. This class contains mostly code generated by the WindowBuilder. This it is not structured nicely and everything is implemented in the constructor. For this task you can ignore all layout-related variables and types, like `GridBagLayout` and `GridBagConstraints`.

### Your Task

- Draw a class diagram containing the following classes of the AWT/Swing framework and the B2B-tec application:
  - `Component` (AWT)
  - `Container` (AWT)
  - `JComponent` (Swing)
  - `JLabel` (Swing)
  - `AbstractButton` (Swing)
  - `JButton` (Swing)
  - `JPanel` (Swing)
  - `AddressPanelBase` (B2B-tec)
  - `AddressPanel` (B2B-tec)
- Identify the composite pattern in the class diagram
  - Which type is the *Composite*?
  - Which type is the *Component*?
  - Are there any *Leaf* types?
- Draw an object diagram of an instance of the `ProfileTabBase` type. As mentioned above, ignore the layout types for this task and focus only on the objects directly created in `ProfileTabBase`'s constructor.
