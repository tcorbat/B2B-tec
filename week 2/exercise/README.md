# Week 2 Exercise - Object-Oriented Design Introduction

## Overview

* Domain Model to Code 

## Transfer your B2B-tec Domain Model into Java Code. The goal of this exercise is repeating UML Class Diagram and it’s relation to program code.
Review the most important aspects of UML Class Diagram Syntax, described in Larman Chapter 7 “UML Class Diagrams”.

* Create a new empty Java project with eclipse.

* If you are familiar with OOD concepts, transform your Domain Model into program code.
	* Create a software class diagram (OOD) according to the Domain Model by applying the major GRASP principles:
		* Information Expert
		* Low Coupling
		* High Cohesion
		* (we will learn how to apply other GRASP patterns during the next lession)
	* Compare your solution with the provided software class diagram.
	* Write down the code according to your diagram and requirements.
* Otherwise, you may use the [provided software class diagram](hhttps://moodle.hsr.ch/pluginfile.php/142879/mod_folder/content/0/Domain%20Class%20Diagram.png?forcedownload=1) and transfer it into code.
	* Write down the code according this diagram and requirements.
* Answer the following questions:
	* What are the differences between the Domain Model and a software class diagram?
	* Which part of program code is not visible in the Domain Model?
* The provided solution also contains Unit Tests to test the logic within our domain. 
	* A quick guide how to download and work with eclipse and the provided solution is illustrated in the [Practices document on Moodle](https://moodle.hsr.ch/pluginfile.php/141859/mod_folder/content/0/B2B-tec%20Exercise%20Setup.pdf?forcedownload=1).
