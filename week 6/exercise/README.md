# Week 6 Exercise

## Refactor Smelly Code
In the lecture we have encountered several code examples containing various code smells. We have discussed why each snipped is suboptimal and how we could improve it. Improve each smell, best by using the refactoring tools integrated into your IDE. 

On Moodle you have a template project containing all examples. Each example contains a short javadoc header explaining the issue and suggesting improvements to be applied. There are various ways to tackle the problems and multiple solutions are possible. Also on Moodle you have a solution project with example solutions.
