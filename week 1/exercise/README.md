* Domain Analysis Exercises
* Domain Modeling Exercise


## Domain Analysis Exercises

1. Find the “real-world” objects (Candidates)
    Please read the Vision document again and the additional requirements document. 
	* Break team into groups of four or five.
    * Find the Candidates:
        * Underline nouns
        * Brainstorm and answer the 7 questions.
    * Document the findings on the CRC cards.
2. Identify and assign Responsibilities
    Lookup responsibilities in the requirements and find an appropriate candidate object that takes the responsibility.
	* Underline the responsibilities in the requirement text.
        * Create new candidates if responsibility can’t be assigned to an existing one (do Step 1 again).
        * Throw away candidates without a responsibility assigned.
    * Document the findings on the CRC cards.
3. Identify Collaborators
    Lookup collaborators in the requirements.
	* Keep the number of collaborations listed on the CRC-Card low.
        * Especially collaborations to general-purpose objects are omitted.
        * Write down one side of the collaboration only (=reading direction).
    * Write them into the Collaborators section.
    * Refine your CRC Cards by doing Step 1 and Step 2again and again…


## Domain Modeling Exercise

Transfer your CRC cards into a Domain Model.

* Use the illustrated subset of the UML Class Diagram syntax:
    * Create Conceptual Classes according your CRC cards.
    * Establish and name associations with the appropriate reading direction.
    * Elaborate attributes of the Conceptual Classes.
* Write your Domain Model down either on paper or draw it by using an UML of your own choice.
